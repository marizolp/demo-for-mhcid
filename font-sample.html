    <p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
    <p class="copy">At first you might think that Prof. Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that he mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous bulb. Making many question whether there was vampire trauma in his past.</p>
